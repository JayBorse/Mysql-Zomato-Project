Zomato Project

Description

This is a database management project simulating a restaurant management system, similar to Zomato. The project includes various functionalities like managing users, restaurants, menu items, orders, reviews, and the relationship between them. It demonstrates practical usage of SQL queries, database design, and normalization techniques to handle restaurant data efficiently.

Features

	•	Restaurants: Store restaurant details, including restaurant name, location, rating, and cuisine.
	•	Menu Items: Manage the menu items of restaurants, including the item name, price, and description.
	•	Orders: Manage customer orders, including the order status, total price, and associated restaurant.
	•	Order Items: Store information about the individual items in an order, including quantity and price.
	•	Reviews: Users can rate restaurants and leave reviews for their experiences.

Database Design

The project includes the following tables:
	1.	Users: Stores user details such as name, email, phone number, and address.
	2.	Restaurants: Stores restaurant details like name, location, rating, and cuisine.
	3.	Menu_Items: Stores details of menu items offered by restaurants, including name, price, and description.
	4.	Orders: Stores customer order information, including status, date, and total price.
	5.	Order_Items: Stores the details of items in each order.

SQL Queries

The project implements various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data, including:
	•	Getting all restaurants and their average rating.
	•	Retrieving all menu items for a particular restaurant.
	•	Finding all orders by a specific user.
	•	Displaying all reviews for a restaurant.
	•	Calculating total earnings for each restaurant.

Learning Outcomes
	•	Database Design: Gained hands-on experience in designing a relational database with proper relationships between entities.
	•	SQL Queries: Enhanced skills in writing complex SQL queries using JOIN operations, aggregate functions, and filtering.
	•	Normalization: Applied normalization principles to reduce redundancy and optimize data structure.
	•	Data Integrity: Implemented constraints like CHECK, DEFAULT, and FOREIGN KEY to ensure data integrity.
